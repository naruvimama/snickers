Test watcher for python projects

It watches files in the project folder and runs tests corresponding to the modified file.
Assumes naming conventions. Should be configurable in the future.
Can be useful for big projects, where only (probably) dependent tests are run.

Uses DRY - to add config file fore finer control.
